      <figcaption>The salmon that started a dream</figcaption>
      <p>Growing up in California my family would often take trips to different areas for fishing trips. In the early Summer of 1979 we embarked on what would be a life changing fishing trip around different areas of Puget Sound. Although only a teenager I had a passion for fishing that rivaled my mother's, a woman who had practically been raised on a fishing boat. That trip we caught some of the most delicious salmon I have ever eaten. I devoured the fish whenever there was a chance. My mother joked that if I could I would eat salmon for dessert. I thought "well, why not?". After three years of culinary school, and many attempts to find just the right balance of fish in the recipe, I've returned to the Puget Sound area where it all began.<p>
      <p>Our mission is to honor the salmon's iconic place in Washington's culture and bring a bit of fun to the table. With our cookies, you'll reap all the health benefits of a serving of salmon while enjoying your cup of coffee on a cloudy Seattle morning. Let us make your mornings a little brighter with our one of a kind salmon cookies.</p>
