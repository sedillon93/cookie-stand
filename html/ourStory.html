      <figcaption>The salmon that started a dream</figcaption>
      <p>Growing up in California Pat's family would often take trips to different areas for fishing trips. In the early Summer of 1979 Pat's family embarked on what would be a life changing fishing trip around different areas of Puget Sound. Although only a teenager Pat had a passion for fishing. That trip they caught some of the most delicious salmon Pat have ever eaten. Pat devoured the fish whenever there was a chance. Pat's mother joked that Pat would eat salmon for dessert, and Pat thought "well, why not?". After three years of culinary school, and many attempts to find just the right balance of fish in the recipe, Pat moved to the Puget Sound area where it all began. Now, Pat is pleased to announce that you too can have your salmon for dessert.<p>
