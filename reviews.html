        As a local restaurant critic, I have the priviledge to be one of the first to sample up and coming creations. This week that meant testing out one of Pat's Salmon Cookies. Stopping by the soon-to-be-store it was evident that Pat and the restaurant team are putting everything they have into this dream. The small restaurant has a casual, cozy atmosphere perfect for lazy Saturday mornings sipping coffee while reading your favorite book. The staff are all very friendly, and Pat is one of the most charming people you could hope to meet. When I arrived Pat greeted me warmly at the door and ushered me in to a quaint nook towards the back where a plate of fresh salmon cookies and a hot pot of coffee were waiting. I have to admit, I was wary to sample the meat filled baked good. Meat based pies have never sat well with me, and this seemed a step too far. With Pat's optimistic eyes glued to me I dutifuly dunked a salmon biscuit into my cup and took the first tentative bite. Let me tell you friends: am I glad I did. As soon as it hits your tongue the cookie starts to dissolve into decadent, buttery, perfectly sweet bliss. I could tell Pat was pleased as I eagerly dipped the cookie a second time. "I knew they would be irresistable," Pat said. "Once people taste what I've made here, my only problem will be keeping enough in stock." I have to say I'm inclined to agree. So readers, if you are looking for a unique, delicious treat to enjoy, look now further than Pat's Salmon Cookie Shop.
